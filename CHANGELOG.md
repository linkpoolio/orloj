# Changelog

All notable changes to Orloj are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Anthropic OAuth access tokens**: the Anthropic model gateway now sends `Authorization: Bearer` for credentials with the `sk-ant-oat` prefix (or an explicit `Bearer ` prefix), while standard API keys continue to use `x-api-key`. Same `ModelEndpoint` `auth.secretRef` works for both.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **A2A protocol support**: expose selected AgentSystems as discoverable A2A agents via `spec.a2a.enabled`, accept inbound A2A task requests (JSON-RPC), call external A2A agents as `type: a2a` tools, and maintain a configured registry of remote agents. Includes Agent Card generation from systems, `POST /a2a` and per-system `POST /v1/agent-systems/{name}/a2a` JSON-RPC endpoints, `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` discovery, auth-filtered `GET /v1/a2a/agents` registry endpoint, scoped API-token role `a2a`, Orloj/A2A task state mapping, outbound A2A client with SSRF protection, A2A-specific Prometheus metrics, `orlojctl a2a card` and `orlojctl a2a test` CLI commands, React SPA A2A Registry page, Helm chart `a2a.*` values, and comprehensive documentation.
- **Per-system A2A invoke auth**: new `spec.a2a.auth` field on AgentSystem (`"public"` or `"bearer"`, default `"bearer"`) allows individual systems to accept unauthenticated A2A invoke while the control plane remains token-protected. Public systems' Agent Cards omit `authentication.schemes`, and the A2A registry shows public systems to unauthenticated callers.

### Fixed

- **A2A: `tasks/get` and `tasks/cancel` auth bypass on bearer systems**: unauthenticated callers could read task output and cancel tasks on `spec.a2a.auth: bearer` systems if they knew the A2A task ID. The permissive `a2aIdentityAllowsSystem` gate now enforces the same bearer requirement as `tasks/send` and `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
- **A2A: `tasks/sendSubscribe` namespace mismatch**: subscribe created tasks in the request query-param namespace (defaulting to `"default"`) instead of using the target AgentSystem's namespace, causing task lookup misses for non-default namespaces.
- **A2A: `--api-key` flag not wired into authorizer**: running `orlojd --api-key secret` without the `ORLOJ_API_TOKEN` env var left auth open while Agent Cards advertised bearer. The flag value is now propagated to the env before server init.
- **A2A: `tasks/get`/`tasks/cancel` cross-system task ID collision**: `findTaskByA2AID` searched all tasks globally by label. When invoked via a per-system URL (`/v1/agent-systems/{name}/a2a`), the lookup is now scoped to the target system.
- **A2A: `tasks/get`/`tasks/cancel` missing task ID validation**: get and cancel accepted empty `params.id`. Empty IDs are now rejected consistently across all four JSON-RPC methods.
- **A2A: subscribe SSE write errors ignored**: heartbeat and status writes did not check for errors, allowing the poll loop to spin briefly after client disconnect. Write failures now terminate the stream immediately and record `client_disconnected` in telemetry.
- **A2A: cancel reason unbounded**: `params.reason` on `tasks/cancel` had no length limit and was stored verbatim. Now capped at 1024 characters with rune-safe truncation.
- **Helm CRD drift**: `charts/orloj/templates/operator-crds.yaml` was missing the `spec.a2a.auth` field present in `config/crd/bases/orloj.dev_agentsystems.yaml`.
- **CLI: `orlojctl a2a card` ignored `--namespace` flag**: the namespace flag was not applied to the card fetch URL. Non-default namespace systems now resolve correctly.
- **Docs: stale A2A security description**: `docs/pages/concepts/a2a-interoperability.md` incorrectly stated that JSON-RPC endpoints require global bearer auth; updated to describe per-system `spec.a2a.auth` model.

### Changed

- **UI: Gold/bronze design system**: replaced green accent palette with a warm gold (#F5B041) and bronze (#D68930) theme across all surfaces, sidebar, cards, and graph nodes. Updated dark and light theme CSS variables for a premium modern feel.
- **UI: Control plane dashboard**: redesigned home page with a bento layout, lifecycle summary cards, resource quick links, and a live task trace feed.
- **UI: Agent system detail page**: redesigned from tab-based layout to a single-page bento-box dashboard featuring a System Health Horizon banner (task success rate with sparkline, API reachability, workers online), full-width topology view with glowing gold edges and pulsing running nodes, and a three-column bottom grid (system definitions, recent tasks, task trace timeline).
- **Docs: README Orloj in Action media**: refreshed screenshots and lifecycle GIF in `docs/public/readme/` for the updated web console.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Trusted private MCP HTTP servers**: `McpServer.spec.allowPrivate: true` now permits HTTP MCP transports to connect to trusted RFC 1918 / ULA / CGNAT destinations, such as in-cluster Kubernetes Services, while loopback, link-local, cloud metadata, and unspecified addresses remain blocked. The field is supported in manifests, CRDs, Helm-embedded CRDs, OpenAPI, and resource docs.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Helm chart: CRD sync operator templates**: new `operator.*` values section and six templates (`operator-deployment`, `operator-serviceaccount`, `operator-rbac`, `operator-pdb`, `operator-servicemonitor`, `operator-crds`) for deploying the `orloj-operator` CRD sync controller. Includes ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding for orloj.dev CRDs, leader election leases, and event recording. All 8 CRD manifests are bundled in `operator-crds.yaml` (conditional on `operator.installCRDs`). Adds `crdConflictPolicy` value (default `warn`) and passes it to the server deployment as `ORLOJ_CRD_CONFLICT_POLICY`.
- **Kubernetes agent execution**: agents in multi-agent tasks can now run as ephemeral Kubernetes Jobs instead of in-process on the worker. The orchestrator (TaskController or AgentMessageConsumerManager) delegates eligible agents to K8s Jobs running the worker image in `--single-agent` mode. Agents with Docker-dependent tools (container isolation or stdio MCP servers with images) transparently fall back to in-process execution. Crash recovery detects existing Jobs by deterministic naming and resumes watching. New `--agent-k8s-*` flags (`--agent-k8s-enabled`, `--agent-k8s-namespace`, `--agent-k8s-service-account`, `--agent-k8s-image`, `--agent-k8s-job-ttl`, `--agent-k8s-default-memory`, `--agent-k8s-default-cpu`) configure the runtime. Helm chart adds `agentExecution.kubernetes.*` values and conditional RBAC for Job/Pod access.
- **Kubernetes tool isolation backend**: tools can now execute as ephemeral Kubernetes Jobs by setting `isolation_mode: kubernetes` in the tool spec. The new backend coexists with the existing Docker container backend -- per-tool `isolation_mode` selects which one handles each tool. New `--tool-k8s-*` flags (`--tool-k8s-enabled`, `--tool-k8s-namespace`, `--tool-k8s-service-account`, `--tool-k8s-job-ttl`, `--tool-k8s-default-image`) configure the runtime independently of `--tool-isolation-backend`. Helm chart adds `toolIsolation.kubernetes.*` values and conditional RBAC for Job/Pod/Secret access. Includes `KubernetesSecretResolver` for resolving secrets from Kubernetes Secrets when running in-cluster.
- **CRD sync operator** (`orloj-operator`): optional component that makes Orloj resources real Kubernetes CRDs, enabling `kubectl apply` and GitOps (Argo CD, Flux) for resource management. The operator watches 8 CRD kinds (Agent, AgentSystem, Tool, McpServer, ModelEndpoint, Memory, AgentPolicy, Secret) and syncs them into Orloj's Postgres store. Status flows back to CRD `.status` subresources so `kubectl get agents` shows phase. Includes ownership annotation (`orloj.dev/managed-by: crd-sync`), conflict guard on the REST API (`--crd-conflict-policy`), finalizer-based deletion, and frontend badges/warnings for CRD-managed resources. Supports `orloj.dev/target-namespace` annotation to decouple K8s namespace from Orloj namespace. Deployed via `operator.enabled: true` in Helm values. Documentation: operator deployment guide (`deploy/kubernetes-operator`), kubectl-vs-orlojctl comparison guide, architecture overview update, `--crd-conflict-policy` flag reference, and operator troubleshooting section.

### Fixed

- **Message-driven agent consumer missing K8s tool runtime**: `AgentMessageConsumerManager.processMessage` was not calling `ConfigureKubernetesRuntime` when building the tool runtime stack, causing tools with `isolation_mode: kubernetes` to fail in message-driven execution mode.
- **CI: CRD schema drift detection**: CI now regenerates CRD manifests and fails if the checked-in YAML is stale, preventing operator schema from diverging from Go type definitions.
- **Operator integration tests (envtest)**: full `envtest`-based test suite exercises the CRD reconciler against a real Kubernetes API server — covers create/update/delete lifecycle, all 8 CRD kinds, upsert error → SyncError status, StatusWriter writeback, and delete retry. Also adds HTTP handler-level tests verifying the POST conflict guard across all resource kinds and all 3 policy modes. CI runs these tests automatically.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Agent Evaluation Framework**: new `EvalDataset` and `EvalRun` resource kinds for declarative agent evaluation. Includes four scoring strategies (`exact_match`, `llm_judge`, `manual`, `custom`), a comparison API (`GET /v1/eval-runs/compare`), manual review workflow with export/annotate/import/finalize, and full `orlojctl eval` CLI subcommand tree. New database migration `013_eval_framework.up.sql`, OpenAPI schemas, and TypeScript frontend types.

### Fixed

- **EvalRun docs and frontend type mismatches**: documentation used `dataset` instead of `dataset_ref`, showed `agent_overrides` as a list instead of a map, and used `system_prompt` instead of `prompt`. Frontend TypeScript types matched the incorrect docs rather than the Go backend. All examples, reference docs, and frontend types now match the actual `EvalRunSpec` schema.
- **EvalRun output grading and progress**: scoring prefers the agent's final model line (`last_output`), strips `step=N model_output=` prefixes and markdown fences before comparison, and JSONPath scoring parses fenced JSON. Running-phase reconciliation persists `completedSamples` for live progress; `DeadLetter` tasks are counted like failures for completion and cancellation. Re-applying an EvalRun resets non-terminal phases (clearing stale results) while preserving terminal `Succeeded` and `PendingReview` status.
- **OpenAPI**: EvalRun-related paths and schema fields aligned with the HTTP API.
- **Helm chart hardening**: conditional NATS URL args (avoid passing empty `--nats-url=` when NATS is disabled), templated `containerPort` and probe settings from values (instead of hardcoded), added `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` to pod security contexts, security context on `helm test` pod, removed dead `postgres-password` key from chart-managed Secret, and removed placeholder sub-chart directories that shadowed real `helm dependency update`.

### Changed

- **EvalRun suspended by default on apply**: `orlojctl apply` now creates EvalRun resources in a suspended state (`spec.suspended: true`) so they do not execute automatically. Use `orlojctl apply --run` to start immediately, `orlojctl eval start <name>` to start a suspended run, or `orlojctl eval run` (unchanged) to create and start in one step. New `POST /v1/eval-runs/{name}/start` API endpoint.
- **Sealed Secrets UI consolidated into Secrets page**: removed the dedicated "Sealed Secrets" navigation entry and pages. Secrets that originate from a `SealedSecret` now show a "Sealed" source badge in the list and detail views, with the owning `SealedSecret` name. Old `/sealed-secrets` URLs redirect to `/secrets`.
- **JetStream API migrated to `jetstream` package**: the agent message bus now uses `jetstream.New(nc)` and the push-based `consumer.Messages()` iterator instead of the deprecated `nc.JetStream()` v1 API with `PullSubscribe`/`Fetch` polling. This eliminates idle CPU from the 2-second poll loop and delivers messages instantly via server-side push with heartbeats.
- **Stream bounded by `MaxBytes`**: the `ORLOJ_AGENT_MESSAGES` stream now enforces a 1 GiB `MaxBytes` cap alongside the existing 7-day `MaxAge`, preventing unbounded disk growth during message bursts.
- **Consumer poison-message protection**: JetStream consumers now set `AckWait: 120s` and `MaxDeliver: 10`, terminating messages that fail processing after 10 attempts instead of redelivering indefinitely.
- **Redundant task lookup eliminated**: `handleDelivery` now passes the already-fetched task into `processMessage`, removing a duplicate `tasks.Get` round-trip on every agent message.
- **Event bus publish failure monitoring**: `NATSBus` now tracks cumulative publish failures with a new `PublishFailures()` accessor for health checks and metrics export, and includes the running failure count in log messages.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **`docker-compose.yml` updated for codebase parity**: added explicit `--max-concurrent-tasks` to workers, surfaced commonly-needed operator env vars (`ORLOJ_AUTH_MODE`, `ORLOJ_API_TOKEN`, `ORLOJ_SETUP_TOKEN`, `ORLOJ_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ORLOJ_LOG_LEVEL`, `ORLOJ_LOG_FORMAT`, `ORLOJ_TOOL_ISOLATION_BACKEND`) on `orlojd`, added `ORLOJ_LOG_LEVEL`/`ORLOJ_LOG_FORMAT` to workers, and defined an explicit `orloj` Docker network for all services.

### Fixed

- **`orlojworker` Dockerfile missing `wget`**: the `orlojworker` container stage now installs `wget` to match `orlojd`, ensuring compose healthchecks work reliably.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Global log level for daemons**: `orlojd` and `orlojworker` accept `--log-level`, `--debug`, and `ORLOJ_LOG_LEVEL` so operators can raise or lower verbosity without rebuilding. Operations docs, the server flags reference, and the Helm chart README include examples (including `runtimeConfig.ORLOJ_LOG_LEVEL` for clusters). Telemetry records the effective parsed log level, forwards debug bridge logs when enabled, and routes configured error-level fatals through the error logger so shutdown paths stay consistent with the chosen level.
- **Targeted debug instrumentation**: additional debug logging around startup/runtime configuration, tool runtime setup, task scheduling and claim/heartbeat loops, worker capacity, and the agent message consumer (receive, skip, retry, ack, and routing decisions) to trace message-driven execution without enabling full trace spam.
- **Kubernetes-style memory suffixes**: `ParseMemoryBytes` now accepts `Gi`, `Mi`, `Ki` suffixes (IEC binary, 1024-based) alongside Docker-style `g`, `m`, `k`.
- **`Agent.ResolvedModel()` accessor**: provides a clear read path for the runtime-resolved model ID, discouraging direct field access on the `json:"-"` tagged `Spec.Model`.

### Changed

- **Relaxed container isolation defaults**: MCP server and tool runtime containers no longer apply `--read-only`, `--cap-drop=ALL`, or `--security-opt no-new-privileges`. The container boundary, resource limits, and network controls remain the primary isolation mechanism. This improves compatibility with images that require writable filesystems or Linux capabilities (e.g. Chromium-based MCP servers).
- **Anthropic API timeout increased**: HTTP timeout for Anthropic API calls raised from 30s to 120s to prevent timeouts on large contexts.

### Fixed

- **DeepCopy BlockedOn pointer isolation**: `Task.DeepCopy()` now deep-copies the `BlockedOn` pointer, preventing shared mutable state across task copies during concurrent reconciliation.
- **Regex ReDoS protection + caching**: Edge condition `output_matches` patterns are length-limited (512 chars) at normalization time and compiled regexes are cached, eliminating per-evaluation re-compilation and catastrophic backtracking vectors.
- **Integer overflow in `ParseMemoryBytes`**: Memory values that overflow int64 when multiplied by their unit (e.g. `"9999999999g"`) now return an error instead of a negative result passed to Docker resource flags.
- **OutputSchema validation**: Agent `output_schema` is now validated during normalization — requires a root `"type"` key, caps nesting at 10 levels, and limits serialized size to 64 KB.
- **YAML multi-document rejection**: All manifest parsers now reject `---` document separators with a descriptive error, preventing silent field corruption from multi-document streams.
- **NormalizeGraphJoin rejects invalid values**: Unknown `join.mode` or `join.on_failure` values now return errors instead of being silently replaced with defaults.
- **Task.Normalize requires system for run mode**: A Task with `mode: run` and empty `spec.system` is now rejected at normalization time rather than failing at runtime.
- **EncodeTaskApprovalResumeContext error propagation**: The function now returns errors instead of silently returning empty maps on marshal/unmarshal failure.
- **Memory ingest content size limit**: `memory.ingest` now rejects payloads exceeding 10 MB, preventing OOM from unbounded content ingestion.
- **Deterministic memory search results**: `SharedMemoryStore.Search` now sorts results by key before truncating to `topK`, producing consistent results across calls.
- **Sealed secret AAD includes algorithm version**: GCM additional authenticated data now includes `AES-256-GCM-v1` as a prefix, with backward-compatible fallback to the legacy AAD format during unseal.
- **YAML inline array quoted commas**: The manifest parser's flow array split now respects quoted strings, so values like `["hello, world", b]` parse correctly instead of splitting on the embedded comma.
- **Standalone `orlojworker` MCP execution parity**: standalone workers now build and own an `McpSessionManager`, configure MCP execution on the task controller, pass MCP dependencies into message-driven agent consumers, start the idle reaper, and close MCP sessions on shutdown. This brings standalone `orlojworker` behavior in line with embedded `orlojd` workers so generated `type=mcp` tools can execute in both task-controller and message-driven flows.
- **Provider-safe tool names across model gateways**: OpenAI-compatible/OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, and Ollama now share consistent tool-name aliasing. Runtime tool names such as `memory.write` are sanitized for provider requests, parsed responses map back to runtime names, and multi-turn assistant tool-call history is re-aliased through the current request's tool alias map so history names match the provider `tools` array. This fixes follow-up turn failures for MCP-style names and built-ins with dots.
- **Trusted local model endpoints under `allowPrivate`**: `ModelEndpoint.spec.allowPrivate: true` now permits trusted local/private model gateways, including loopback Ollama and local OpenAI-compatible servers, while still blocking cloud metadata, link-local, and unspecified addresses. Generic tool and MCP egress protections remain unchanged.
- **Anthropic consecutive user messages**: Tool result and text messages with the same `user` role are now merged into a single message, fixing `400` errors from the Anthropic Messages API.
- **Empty Anthropic content handling**: When Anthropic returns 200 OK with an empty content array, the agent worker now completes gracefully instead of erroring with "model response missing message content" and retrying indefinitely.
- **Agent worker termination on empty output**: The agent loop now stops when no tools are available and the model produces no output, preventing infinite loops.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Tool approval input visibility**: ToolApproval resources now capture the full tool call arguments in `spec.input` so reviewers can see exactly what they are approving. The frontend detail page renders the input as formatted JSON, and `orlojctl get tool-approvals` includes a truncated INPUT column.
- **McpServer `spec.default_tool_runtime`**: MCP server manifests now support a `default_tool_runtime` field that sets the default timeout, isolation mode, and retry policy for all generated Tool resources. This avoids needing per-tool runtime overrides for servers with uniform latency characteristics.
- **Real-time trace streaming**: Agent execution trace events (tool calls, model calls, step completions) now stream to the frontend in real time via SSE rather than appearing in a batch after execution completes. The TaskDetail trace tab shows events as they happen during long-running agent executions. Intermediate task upserts after each agent in a pipeline ensure partial progress is persisted even if the task is interrupted.
- **Per-tool and per-McpServer container resource limits**: Tool manifests now support `spec.cli.resources` and McpServer manifests support `spec.resources` with `memory`, `cpus`, and `pids_limit` fields that override the global `--tool-container-{memory,cpus,pids-limit}` defaults. This allows resource-intensive tools (e.g. Chromium-based MCP servers) to declare their own container limits without raising the global defaults for all tools. Operator-level ceilings (`--tool-container-max-memory`, `--tool-container-max-cpus`, `--tool-container-max-pids-limit`) can optionally cap per-tool overrides; manifests exceeding the ceiling are rejected at apply time.
- **Provider-level prompt caching for Anthropic and Bedrock**: The Anthropic gateway now sends `cache_control` markers on system messages and tool definitions, enabling Anthropic's server-side prompt caching (up to 90% input token cost reduction on cached prefixes). The Bedrock gateway appends `cachePoint` blocks to system content and tool configurations for equivalent savings when using Claude models via AWS Bedrock. No configuration required — caching hints are sent automatically on all requests.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **TaskSchedule `spec.task_template`**: Schedules now support inline task specs via `task_template`, matching the existing TaskWebhook capability. This eliminates the need for a separate template Task resource when only the schedule references it. `task_ref` and `task_template` are mutually exclusive; existing schedules using `task_ref` continue to work unchanged.

### Fixed

- **YAML manifest parser silently drops fields**: the constrained-YAML parser ignored several documented spec fields, causing them to be silently discarded on `apply`. Fixed: `image_pull_secret` on Tool CLI and McpServer, `fallback_model_refs` and `allowed_tools` on Agent, `allowPrivate` on ModelEndpoint, `max_child_depth` and `max_child_tasks` on AgentPolicy, `headerName`/`tokenURL`/`scopes` on McpServer auth, `algorithm`/`payload_format`/`payload_prefix`/`payload_separator`/`signature_encoding`/`header_format`/`signature_key`/`timestamp_key` on TaskWebhook auth, and `task_template.mode` on TaskSchedule and TaskWebhook. JSON manifests were unaffected.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`ContextAdapter` resource and AgentSystem `spec.context_adapter`**: reference a sanitization Tool (`spec.tool_ref`) with `spec.on_error` (`reject`|`passthrough`). The tool receives raw task input as JSON and returns sanitized JSON — the adapter enforces the contract but leaves sanitization logic entirely to the tool. Adapts input before the first agent runs in both sequential and message-driven execution flows. CRUD at `/v1/context-adapters`; web console includes list/detail pages, sidebar navigation, create template, and Agent System status linking.
- **AgentPolicy `spec.target_agents`**: Policies can now target specific agents within a system. When `target_agents` is set, only listed agents are subject to the policy's constraints (model checks, blocked tools, token budget). Enables per-agent token budgets and fine-grained tool restrictions without splitting agent systems.
- **Memory `spec.endpoint_secret_ref`**: Memory resources now support resolving the endpoint connection string from a Secret reference, keeping sensitive infrastructure details (hostnames, DSNs) out of plaintext manifests. Mutually exclusive with `spec.endpoint`; when set, the controller resolves the Secret and uses its value as the endpoint.
- **Approval resolution trace events**: Task and tool approval outcomes (`approved`, `denied`, `expired`, `changes_requested`) are now recorded in `task.status.trace` with the reviewer identity and comment. Previously only the `pending` event was traced, leaving no audit trail for the decision itself.

### Fixed

- YAML manifest parser now correctly strips inline comments after quoted values (e.g. `value: "sk-secret" # comment`). Previously the comment text and quotes leaked into the stored value, causing silent authentication failures when used in Secrets.
- Model gateway cache now invalidates when a referenced Secret's `ResourceVersion` changes, not only when the `ModelEndpoint` itself changes. Previously, rotating an API key Secret required restarting `orlojd` or re-applying the ModelEndpoint for the new key to take effect.
- Anthropic and Bedrock model gateways now auto-strip unsupported JSON Schema keywords (`additionalProperties`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `pattern`, etc.) from `output_schema` before sending to the provider, preventing 400 errors when using structured output with schemas authored for OpenAI.
- `orlojctl apply -f <dir>` no longer errors on non-manifest files (e.g. JSON data files without a `kind` field); such files are silently skipped.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`SealedSecret` resource and sealing workflow**: Orloj now supports git-safe encrypted secret manifests. `orlojd` manages a DB-backed RSA sealing keypair, exposes `GET /v1/sealing-key/public`, and reconciles `SealedSecret` resources into normal `Secret` resources through the existing secret storage path. `orlojctl` adds `seal public-key` plus `seal secret` workflows for both source manifests and inline `--from-literal` input, defaults to writing `*.sealed.yaml` files for git usage, the API/UI/OpenAPI now expose `sealed-secrets`, and generated Secrets are marked with `orloj.dev/sealedsecret-owner` for conflict detection and orphan cleanup.
- Agent `spec.fallback_model_refs` enables ordered model endpoint failover; the router cascades to fallback endpoints on retryable provider errors (429, 5xx, connection failures).
- **Embedded WASM tool runtime (wazero)**: WASM tools now execute in-process via a pure-Go [wazero](https://wazero.io) runtime instead of shelling out to an external binary. No external WASM runtime binary is required. Each tool declares its module path and resource limits in `spec.wasm` (module, entrypoint, max_memory_bytes, fuel, enable_wasi). Compiled modules are cached for reuse. WASM tools work independently of `--tool-isolation-backend` and coexist with container-isolated tools in the same agent system.
- **Remote WASM module loading**: `spec.wasm.module` now accepts HTTPS URLs and OCI artifact references (`oci://...`) in addition to local paths. Modules are fetched, SHA-256-keyed, and cached on disk (`--tool-wasm-cache-dir`). Private OCI registries are supported via `spec.wasm.image_pull_secret`. SSRF protection is enforced on all remote fetches.
- **Frontend WASM tool UI**: The web console now shows WASM-specific configuration (module, entrypoint, memory limit, fuel, WASI, image pull secret) on the Tool detail page and offers a "Tool (WASM)" template in the create resource dialog.
- **WASM tool observability**: Prometheus metrics for tool execution duration (`orloj_tool_execution_duration_seconds`), fuel consumed (`orloj_wasm_fuel_consumed`), compilation cache hits/misses, and remote module fetch duration. The tool execution duration metric covers all tool types, not just WASM.
- **`orlojctl tool scaffold`**: Generates a ready-to-build WASM tool project with contract-compliant guest code (Go or Rust), Makefile, tool manifest, test fixtures, and a README. Usage: `orlojctl tool scaffold <name> --lang go|rust`.
- **`orlojctl tool test`**: Test framework that validates WASM modules against JSON fixture files. Checks contract compliance, expected output, and resource budgets. Usage: `orlojctl tool test <module.wasm> --fixtures <dir>`.

### Changed

- `--tool-isolation-backend` now only controls container sandboxing (`none|container`). The `wasm` option has been removed; WASM tools always use the embedded wazero runtime.
- Default WASM fuel limit changed from `0` (disabled) to `1000000` to enforce execution step limits by default.

### Removed

- `--tool-wasm-runtime-binary` and `--tool-wasm-runtime-args` server flags (and corresponding `ORLOJ_TOOL_WASM_RUNTIME_BINARY` / `ORLOJ_TOOL_WASM_RUNTIME_ARGS` env vars). The embedded wazero runtime replaces subprocess-based execution.

### Fixed

- Frontend: list pages (Agents, Tasks, Agent Systems, Secrets) now show error states with retry instead of silently displaying "No resources" on API failures.
- Frontend: Capabilities page error state upgraded from raw `<p>` to reusable `ListFetchError` component with retry button.
- Frontend: TaskDetail sub-resource queries (messages, metrics, logs) surface fetch errors instead of showing empty placeholders.
- Frontend: clickable cards and navigation spans replaced with keyboard-accessible elements (`role="button"`, `tabIndex`, or `<button>`).
- Frontend: TaskDetail tab bar uses ARIA `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `aria-selected` semantics.
- Frontend: removed inline styles in TaskDetail and Capabilities; replaced with utility CSS classes.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Private registry image pull support for McpServer and CLI tools**: `McpServer` and CLI `Tool` specs now accept an `image_pull_secret` field referencing a Secret with registry credentials. The Secret can contain structured `registry`/`username`/`password` keys or a raw `.dockerconfigjson` blob. Orloj writes a temporary Docker config and sets `DOCKER_CONFIG` for pull and run commands, keeping the host daemon's credential store clean. Works with Docker Hub, GHCR, GitLab, Google Artifact Registry, Azure ACR, Quay, Harbor, JFrog, and any registry accepting static credentials.

### Fixed

- **`short_circuit` duplicate tool call policy falsely denies re-requested tools**: when the `short_circuit` policy filtered already-called tools from the available list, the same filtered list was used for tool authorization. If the model re-requested a tool from a previous step (e.g. `kubectl-get` with different parameters), `selectAuthorizedToolCalls` rejected it as unauthorized instead of letting the existing short-circuit cache handler decide. This caused intermittent `tool_permission_denied` fatal errors (~50% of multi-step agent runs). Authorization now checks against the full agent tool list, so re-requested tools reach the cache handler which correctly returns cached results for same-input calls or executes normally for different inputs.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Web UI system topology: initial zoom clamped for large systems**: the graph view now constrains `fitView` to a 0.45×–1.0× zoom range on load. Large systems start at a readable zoom level (nodes visible, pan to explore) instead of shrinking to fit the entire graph; small systems no longer over-zoom beyond 1:1 scale. Manual zoom remains unrestricted (0.15×–2×).

### Fixed

- **Parallel tool calls with mixed success/error results break subsequent model calls**: when the model issued multiple tool calls in one step and some failed (e.g. MCP `tool_backend_failure`), the failed results were not included as `tool_result` blocks in the conversation history. This left orphaned `tool_use` IDs that the Anthropic API rejected with a 400 error on every subsequent step, causing the agent to exhaust `max_steps` without making progress. Error tool results are now always appended to history with `is_error` set (Anthropic `is_error: true`, Bedrock `Status: error`), so the model receives feedback for every tool call regardless of outcome.
- **Web UI system topology: inline webhook task node squished between webhook and system**: `TaskWebhook` resources with an inline `task_template` (no `task_ref`) created a synthetic task node with edges pointing back toward the system node (`inline_task → system`), causing dagre to place it to the left of the system and squeeze it into the webhook–system gap. The edge direction now matches normal tasks (`system → inline_task`), so inline webhook tasks sit alongside other tasks to the right of the system node.
- **Web UI system topology: nodes with long names overlap across ranks**: dagre allocated a fixed 180px width for secondary nodes (tools, roles, secrets, models, memory) regardless of label length. Nodes with long names rendered wider than their allocated slot, causing visual overlap with adjacent ranks. Node width is now estimated from label length (capped at 340px) so dagre reserves enough horizontal space for the actual rendered content.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **AWS Bedrock model provider**: added `bedrock` (aliases `aws-bedrock`, `aws_bedrock`) as a first-class model provider using the Converse API via `aws-sdk-go-v2`. Supports all Bedrock-hosted models (Claude, Llama, Titan, Mistral, Nova, etc.) through a single code path, with tool use, structured output, and full IAM credential chain support (explicit keys via `secretRef` or automatic resolution from env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, EC2/ECS IAM roles, SSO).
- **Human review checkpoints with `TaskApproval`**: Orloj can now pause a workflow for human review of agent output or final task output. `AgentSystem` graph nodes support `spec.graph.<node>.review`, and systems support `spec.completion_review`, each with `checkpoint_id`, `reason`, `ttl`, `allow_request_changes`, and `max_review_cycles`. Reviewers can `approve`, `deny`, or `request_changes`; change requests rerun the producing agent with `review.*` context and create a new approval cycle linked through `spec.supersedes`.
- **Task approval API, CLI, UI, and OpenAPI support**: added `POST/GET /v1/task-approvals`, `GET/DELETE /v1/task-approvals/{name}`, and decision endpoints for `approve`, `deny`, and `request-changes`. The web console now has first-class `TaskApproval` detail pages and a unified approvals queue, `orlojctl` supports `get task-approvals` plus approval actions, and the generated OpenAPI schema documents the full resource and decision surface.
- **Human review docs and examples**: added `TaskApproval` concept/reference pages, a `Human Review Checkpoints` guide, sidebar navigation entries, and sequential/message-driven example manifests for review-gated systems and tasks.

### Changed

- **Explicit task approval blocker tracking**: tasks in `WaitingApproval` now persist `status.blocked_on` with the exact blocking approval kind, name, and reason. This makes approval resume deterministic for both `ToolApproval` and `TaskApproval` flows and exposes the active blocker in the UI/API.
- **Approval decision comments are consistent across approval types**: tool approval approve/deny endpoints and CLI commands now accept optional reviewer `comment` values, matching the audit/comment model used by task approvals.
- **Web UI reskin (modernized visual theme)**: retuned the design-token palette for a contemporary look while preserving the green brand and existing information architecture. Backgrounds are now neutral near-black (`#09090b`/`#111113`) instead of blue-tinted GitHub gray; the accent is a softened mint (`#4ade80`) reserved for CTAs and active states, with the saturated `#22c55e` green kept only for `Ready`/`Succeeded` status. Cards use hover-reveal borders over subtle elevation instead of persistent hard borders; page titles and stat values are larger (1.75rem / 2rem) with tightened letter-spacing; zero-value metric cards are dimmed to de-emphasize empty state. The sidebar active item is a neutral pill with a 2px accent left-bar (replacing the solid green-tinted highlight), and category labels are tighter with increased letter-spacing. The topbar gained a glassmorphism backdrop (14px blur with saturation) and a prominent `⌘K` search chip trigger (previously icon-only). Graph nodes now have a type-specific 2px colored top stripe (system/agent/model/tool/secret/memory/role/task/schedule/webhook/worker), soft elevation on hover, and a green `--accent-glow` when running. Dependency edges are solid 1.5px with animated flow only on active routes. The minimap is now opt-in via a toolbar toggle button alongside the legend toggle. Trace event type badges switched from saturated full-color chips to neutral monospace pills with a colored dot, reducing the "rainbow" appearance of long traces. All changes are token- and CSS-driven; no layout, IA, or backend changes.
- **Web UI**: agent role resources use the `UserCog` icon in the system graph, sidebar, and search (replacing `KeyRound`, which was easy to mistake for the tools wrench at small sizes)
- **Web UI system topology: edge polish and honest flow animation**: dependency edges (the dashed gray lines between agents and their model/tools/secrets/roles/memory) are now legible at rest — `--edge-stroke` in the dark theme moved from `#3a3a3f` to `#71717a` and the two stacked opacity damps (inline `0.5` plus CSS `stroke-opacity: 0.55`) were collapsed to a single `stroke-opacity: 0.6` in CSS. Hovering a node now also shifts its related dependency edges to an accent-tinted stroke (`color-mix(--accent 60%, --edge-stroke)`) so the highlighted sub-graph reads as a cohesive group, not just "same line, thicker." Routing edges no longer paint solid green at rest — they share the neutral `--edge-stroke` with dependency edges (solid instead of dashed, slightly thicker and more opaque, so the pipeline path still reads as the primary flow). They only turn green when flow is actually happening, and even then, on the system detail graph only the specific hops landing on a currently-running agent churn (edge target ∈ `runningAgents`), so a single in-flight pipeline shows motion on one edge at a time instead of every routing edge moving in lockstep; on the task detail graph animation is gated on `task.status.phase === "Running"`. Hovering a node also paints its related routing edges full accent green to signal the relevant pipeline path. This keeps systems with many idle agents visually quiet while still giving live activity a clear green signal. The flow animation itself was slowed from `0.8s linear` to `1.6s ease-in-out` so it reads as agentic flow rather than a network spinner.
- **Web UI system topology: hover highlighting now follows semantic dependencies, not just direct edges**: previously, hovering an agent only lit up nodes connected by a direct graph edge, so a shared model endpoint (edged to the system node to keep the graph readable) or a transitive dependency like a tool's secret never highlighted. The hover logic now uses a precomputed "semantic neighbour" map that records every agent's `model_ref` (and that model's `auth.secretRef`), its `spec.tools` (and each tool's `auth.secretRef`), `spec.roles`, and `memory.ref`, regardless of whether the rendered edge landed on the agent or got re-routed to the system. All of an agent's declared dependencies now light up on hover.
- **Web UI system topology: rerun instances collapse to a single node per task lineage**: reruns of the same task (tracked via `orloj.dev/source-task` label) no longer stack up alongside the original in the topology graph. Each lineage renders exactly one node: an active instance (`Pending`/`Running`/`WaitingApproval`) when one exists, otherwise the most recent terminal instance (`Succeeded`/`Failed`/`DeadLetter`) by `createdAt`. Failed or dead-lettered runs stay visible until a new run of the same lineage starts, so breakages aren't hidden. Templates (`spec.mode: template`) are always preserved so schedule/webhook wiring remains intact. Full execution history is unchanged on the Tasks page.

### Fixed

- **Rate limiter goroutine leak**: `authRateLimiter` no longer spawns a background goroutine per instance; cleanup runs inline during `allow()`, throttled to every 5 minutes
- **Watch streams killed by request timeout**: SSE watch endpoints (`/watch` suffix) now bypass the global read timeout middleware
- **Watch polling with event bus present**: `watchResourceStream` now subscribes to the event bus reactively instead of polling snapshots every 1s when a bus is available
- **Task controller claim scoping bug**: fixed incorrect indentation/brace alignment in `ReconcileOnce` that caused slot release and early-return paths to execute at the wrong scope
- **Slice aliasing in worker claim hints**: `workerClaimHints()` now copies `SupportedModels` to prevent mutations from corrupting the worker spec
- **Work queue blocking on full channel**: replaced fixed-size channel with a growable slice + notify channel so `Enqueue` never blocks
- **Event bus subscriber double-close panic**: `Subscribe` goroutine now uses a single deferred cleanup, preventing races on concurrent context cancellation
- **Agent message bus close/send panic**: `Close()` now signals via a broadcast `done` channel instead of closing individual subscriber channels, eliminating send-on-closed-channel races
- **Bounded tool helpers leaking goroutines**: removed redundant wrapper goroutines in `callToolRuntimeBounded`, `runContainerCommandBounded`, and `executeWASMToolBounded`; the underlying runtimes already honor context cancellation
- **Embedding provider data race**: `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.dimensions` is now an `atomic.Int64`
- **MCP HTTP transport session ID race**: added `RWMutex` for session reads/writes and a serialization mutex for session establishment
- **MCP image inspect swallowing errors**: `ensureImagePulled` now distinguishes "image not found" from actual Docker daemon errors instead of treating all failures as "not present"
- **Webhook poll errors silently dropped**: non-context HTTP errors from poll requests now return a proper `ToolError` instead of `nil`
- **Task store returning shared references**: all `TaskStore` read/write paths now deep-copy tasks to prevent callers from corrupting store state
- **Worker heartbeat shutdown using cancelled context**: the final "NotReady" write now uses a fresh 5s context instead of the already-cancelled parent
- **SQL claim missing GPU/model filters**: `claimNextDueTaskSQL` now filters on `RequiresGPU` and `SupportedModels` hints, preventing workers from claiming incompatible tasks

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **CLI migrated from Go `flag` to cobra/pflag**: `orlojctl` now uses [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for command and flag parsing, matching the UX conventions of `kubectl`. Flags like `-n`/`--namespace` now work correctly when placed after positional arguments (e.g. `orlojctl delete agent my-agent -n prod`), fixing a long-standing parsing bug where trailing flags were silently ignored. Shell completions (`orlojctl completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell`) now use Cobra's built-in generators.

### Fixed

- **HTTP tool runtime: third-party `"status"` fields no longer trigger a false "missing error envelope" error**: the HTTP tool client previously treated any 2xx response whose JSON body contained a non-empty `status` field as an Orloj tool-contract envelope. APIs like Vapi that return `"status": "queued"` in their success payloads would therefore fail with `tool response missing error envelope` because no `error` object was present. The check is now restricted to the three Orloj-defined status values (`ok`, `error`, `denied`); any other value causes the raw response body to be returned as the tool output.

- **HTTP tools with `auth.secretRef` no longer fail with "no secret resolver is configured"**: `ConfigureHttpRuntime` is now called in both the message-driven worker (`AgentMessageConsumer`) and the synchronous task controller alongside the existing `ConfigureCliRuntime` / `ConfigureExternalRuntime` / `ConfigureGRPCRuntime` / `ConfigureWebhookCallbackRuntime` calls. Previously, the HTTP base runtime (`GovernedToolRuntime.baseRuntime`) was always constructed with a `nil` secret resolver, causing every HTTP tool that declared `spec.auth.secretRef` to fail at call time with a non-retryable `secret_resolution_failed` error regardless of whether the secret existed in the store.

- **Embedded worker secret resolver missing in `orlojd`**: the `AgentMessageConsumerOptions` struct in `cmd/orlojd/main.go` was missing `SecretResolver`, so the embedded message-driven worker in `orlojd` (started with `--embedded-worker`) always ran with a `nil` secret resolver. Any tool using `spec.auth.secretRef` would fail with `secret_resolution_failed` even when the secret existed in the store. The `cliSecretResolver` (store-backed + env-var chain) is now passed as `SecretResolver` in the embedded consumer options, matching the wiring in `cmd/orlojworker/main.go`.

- **Docker-image MCP servers: three fixes for container initialization failures**: (1) The YAML parser for `McpServer` now parses `mountPath` / `mount_path` on env entries, so file-based secrets (e.g. a kubeconfig) are correctly bind-mounted into the container instead of being silently dropped — fixing `No active cluster!` crashes. (2) Container images are pre-pulled (`docker pull`, 5 min timeout) before `docker run`, so the image-download time no longer eats the 30-second initialize handshake timeout. (3) `--tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid` is added to `docker run` so Node.js-based servers that need a writable temp directory work under `--read-only`. (4) The child process is no longer bound to the init-timeout context via `exec.CommandContext`, which previously killed healthy containers the moment the init handshake completed and the timeout context was cancelled.

- **MCP server secret resolver now scoped to server namespace**: `resolveEnv` and `buildHTTPTransport` in `McpSessionManager` now call `WithNamespace` (when the resolver supports it) to scope secret lookups to the `McpServer` resource's own namespace, matching the behaviour of CLI tool secrets. Previously, bare secret names (e.g. `secretRef: my-secret`) resolved against the default namespace and the format `name/value` was misread as `namespace/name`, causing "not found" errors for any secret referenced by env var on a Docker-image MCP server.

- **Task controller: MCP tool references no longer permanently fail on startup race**: when a task is applied before the MCP server has finished connecting and registering its tools, the task controller now detects the transient condition (MCP server phase is neither `Ready` nor `Error`) and requeues the task instead of marking it permanently `Failed`. Once the server becomes `Ready` and the tools appear, the task proceeds normally. Non-MCP tool references that are genuinely missing still fail immediately.

- **Secret YAML parser: literal block scalars (`key: |`) now parsed correctly**: the line-based `parseSecretManifestWithoutNormalize` parser previously did not understand YAML literal block scalars. A multi-line value such as a kubeconfig under `spec.stringData.value: |` was stored as the bare `|` character, and any embedded YAML keys in the content (e.g. `kind: Config` from a kubeconfig) overwrote the Orloj resource's own `kind` field, causing `unsupported kind "Config" for Secret` at apply time. The parser now accumulates literal block content into the correct key and guards `kind`/`apiVersion` assignment to document-root lines only (`indent == 0`).

### Added

- **Task rerun on apply**: `apply --run` now re-executes terminal tasks (DeadLetter, Failed, Succeeded) by creating a new task instance with a unique name (`<name>-run-<timestamp>`); the original task is preserved for history. The `?rerun=true` query parameter is also available on `POST /v1/tasks` for programmatic clients. Returns `409 Conflict` if the task is still active. Both `--run` (apply) and `retry` now set `orloj.dev/source-task` and `orloj.dev/source-task-namespace` labels on new instances for lineage tracking.

- **Real-scenario `18-mcp-k8s-docker`**: new live-validation scenario that registers `ghcr.io/strowk/mcp-k8s-go` as a Docker-image MCP server (`spec.image`), delivers a kubeconfig to the container via file-based secret (`mountPath: /secrets/kubeconfig`), and runs a triage agent that calls `list_namespaces` and `list_pods` against a real cluster. Gate checks tool auto-generation (type=mcp), `tool_filter` enforcement (exactly 2 tools), trace coverage, and required output markers. New `make real-apply-k8s-mcp`, `make real-gate-k8s-mcp`, and `make real-gate-wave6` targets.

- **Real-scenario `19-sales-system`**: new example scenario demonstrating an AI-powered outbound sales pipeline with Vapi voice calling. An AgentSystem handles two phases via conditional `input_type` routing: outreach (lead qualification → Vapi AI call) and follow-up (transcript analysis → CRM update → meeting booking → reporting). The Vapi end-of-call webhook is received by a `TaskWebhook` resource (`shared_token` auth via `x-vapi-secret` header) that creates a fresh task per call, avoiding fixed-name conflicts and providing authenticated delivery. The Vapi payload lands under `vapi_payload` in task input; `input_type: transcript` is injected by the template, so the router routes correctly without a proxy.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Conditional edge routing for AgentSystem graphs**: graph edges can now carry an optional `condition` that is evaluated against the completing agent's output. Supported operators: `output_contains` (case-insensitive substring), `output_not_contains`, `output_matches` (regex), and `default` (fallback). When conditions are present, only matched edges fire, enabling data-dependent routing patterns like triage, quality gates, and intelligent hierarchical delegation. Join gates (`wait_for_all`, `quorum`) automatically adjust their expected branch count when conditional routing reduces the set of dispatched upstream agents. Requires message-driven execution mode.
- **JSON path conditions for structured routing**: edge conditions now support `output_json_path` with comparison operators (`equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `greater_than`, `less_than`) to route on specific fields within JSON agent output. Paths use dot-notation (e.g. `$.route`, `$.result.confidence`). `contains` works with both arrays (element membership) and strings (substring match). Numeric operators parse string thresholds for type-safe comparison.
- **Structured output for agents**: new `spec.execution.output_schema` field on Agent resources. Defines a JSON Schema that constrains the model's output via provider-native structured output (constrained decoding). Supported across OpenAI (`response_format.json_schema`), Azure OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Anthropic (`output_config.format`), and Ollama (best-effort `format` field). Pairs with JSON path conditions for end-to-end typed routing.
- **Delegation primitive for graph nodes**: new `delegates` and `delegate_join` fields on `GraphEdge` enable two-phase node execution — dispatch to downstream delegates, collect their reports via a delegation gate, re-execute the node with all results in context (`inbox.delegation.*`), then follow normal edges. Supports the same condition operators, join modes (`wait_for_all`, `quorum`), and structured output as regular edges. Delegates automatically route back to the delegator when they reach a terminal point. `delegate_of` metadata propagates through sub-branches for multi-hop delegation trees. Enables hierarchical agent systems (CEO → VPs → Leads) where each manager is a single graph node.

### Security

- **SSRF hardening for outbound runtimes**: all outbound HTTP callers (model gateways, MCP HTTP transport, HTTP/external/webhook-callback tool runtimes, persistent-memory backend, OpenAI embedding provider, OAuth2 token cache) now route through a shared `SafeHTTPClient` whose `net.Dialer.Control` hook enforces SSRF policy against the actual resolved IP at dial time. This closes the previous hostname-bypass gap where `ValidateEndpointURL` only inspected literal IPs and trusted hostnames (including DNS-rebind attacks and names like `metadata.google.internal` that resolve to 169.254.169.254). Loopback, link-local, cloud metadata (AWS/GCP/Azure IMDS, including IPv6 `fd00:ec2::254`), RFC 6598 carrier-grade NAT (100.64.0.0/10), and unspecified addresses are blocked regardless of the allowPrivate flag; RFC 1918 and IPv6 ULA addresses are blocked unless the caller explicitly opts in.
- **`spec.allowPrivate` on `ModelEndpoint`**: new optional boolean that permits a specific model gateway to reach RFC 1918 / ULA / CGNAT destinations. Defaults: `ollama` → `true` (preserves existing local Ollama deployments), every other provider (`openai`, `openai-compatible`, `anthropic`, `azure-openai`, and custom providers) → `false`. **Upgrade note:** if you run an OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, LM Studio, LocalAI, LiteLLM, TGI, etc.) on `localhost` or a private network under `provider: openai-compatible`, you must set `spec.allowPrivate: true` on those `ModelEndpoint` resources after upgrading or the gateway will fail at dial time with a "private address … is not allowed" error naming the exact field to change.
- **Host CLI tool creation requires admin**: creating or updating a Tool with `spec.type: cli` and `spec.runtime.isolation_mode: none` (host execution) now requires the `admin` role. Writers can still create container-isolated CLI tools and all other tool types. This mirrors the existing admin gate on `/v1/mcp-servers`.
- **CLI runtime fails closed without command allowlist**: the host CLI tool runtime now refuses execution when `ORLOJ_CLI_TOOL_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` is not configured, instead of allowing any command. **Upgrade note:** if you use host CLI tools (`isolation_mode: none`), ensure `ORLOJ_CLI_TOOL_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` is set to the commands you want to permit, or switch to `isolation_mode: container`.
- **Auth rate-limit bypass via spoofed forwarding headers**: `extractClientIP` no longer unconditionally trusts `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` headers. By default, forwarding headers are ignored and the TCP peer address is used for per-client rate limiting. New flag `--trusted-proxies` (env: `ORLOJ_TRUSTED_PROXIES`) accepts comma-separated CIDRs of reverse proxies whose forwarding headers should be trusted; when configured, `X-Forwarded-For` is parsed right-to-left to extract the real client IP. The same trust gate now applies to `X-Forwarded-Proto` for session cookie security. **Upgrade note:** if Orloj runs behind a reverse proxy, set `--trusted-proxies` to your proxy's CIDR(s) to preserve per-client auth rate limiting; without it, all clients behind the proxy share a single rate-limit bucket.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Ephemeral MCP sessions with idle timeout**: new `spec.idle_timeout` field on McpServer resources (e.g. `5m`). Sessions are automatically shut down after the configured idle period and transparently recreated on the next `tools/call`. Tool resources persist in the store so agents always know what tools are available. Default `0` preserves the current always-on behavior.
- **Container-backed MCP stdio transport**: new `spec.image` field on McpServer resources. When set, the MCP server runs inside a Docker container (`docker run --rm -i`) with sandboxing (read-only FS, cap-drop=ALL, memory/CPU limits). If `command` is also set it overrides the image entrypoint; if only `image` is set the image's built-in entrypoint is used.
- **File-based secrets for container MCP servers**: new `mountPath` field on `spec.env` entries. When set, the resolved secret value is written to the specified path inside the container as a bind-mounted file, enabling MCP servers that require file-based credentials (e.g. OAuth JSON keys, service account files). The env var is set to the mount path so the server can locate the file.

### Fixed

- **MCP spec-drift detection**: editing an McpServer spec (e.g. changing the image tag or command) now correctly tears down the stale session and rebuilds with the updated spec, instead of silently returning the cached session.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Inline task templates for TaskWebhook**: `spec.task_template` can now be used as an alternative to `spec.task_ref`, allowing a webhook to embed its task spec directly without creating a separate Task resource. Exactly one of `task_ref` or `task_template` must be set.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **`event_id_from_body` for TaskWebhook idempotency**: extract the deduplication event ID from the JSON request body using a dot-separated field path (e.g. `update_id`, `data.event_id`), instead of requiring an HTTP header. Enables direct Telegram-to-Orloj webhook integration without a proxy, since Telegram puts `update_id` in the body, not a header. When `event_id_from_body` is set, `event_id_header` is no longer required.

### Fixed

- **Tool `description` and `input_schema` dropped by YAML parser**: the constrained YAML manifest parser for Tool resources did not populate `spec.description` or `spec.input_schema`, causing the model to receive a generic fallback schema instead of the tool's actual JSON Schema. This led to malformed tool call arguments (e.g. `invalid character 'ð'` errors) when the model wrapped its response in the fallback `{input: string}` envelope.
- **Docker socket access for container tool isolation**: all Docker Compose files now mount `/var/run/docker.sock` and set `group_add: ["0"]` on `orlojd` and `orlojworker` services, and both images include `docker-cli`. Previously, containerized tool execution silently failed because the Docker CLI was missing and the socket was not accessible.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Webhook delivery auth bypass**: `POST /v1/webhook-deliveries/*` is now exempt from global API token authentication, allowing external senders (Telegram, GitHub, etc.) to deliver webhooks without an Orloj Bearer token. Authentication for these endpoints is handled by the TaskWebhook resource's own auth profile (HMAC signature or shared token).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Built-in orloj tools**: `orloj.task.create` and `orloj.task.list` built-in tools for cross-task orchestration. Agents with these in `spec.allowed_tools` can create tasks from templates (fire-and-forget) and list tasks by label. Child tasks are linked via `orloj.dev/parent-task` and `orloj.dev/depth` labels. Governed like any other tool via ToolPermission, AgentPolicy `blocked_tools`, and ToolApproval.
- **AgentPolicy child task limits**: `max_child_depth` and `max_child_tasks` fields on AgentPolicy to prevent runaway task creation chains. Defaults: depth 5, children 20.
- **TaskWebhook auth profiles**: `hmac` and `shared_token` profiles for TaskWebhook, supporting configurable HMAC algorithm (`sha256`, `sha1`, `sha512`), payload format (`body`, `timestamp_dot_body`, `prefix_timestamp_body`), signature encoding (`hex`, `base64`), and structured header parsing (`kv_pairs` for Stripe-style combined headers). The `shared_token` profile enables constant-time token comparison for services like Telegram. Existing `generic` and `github` profiles are unchanged.
- **README**: Document official [Python](https://pypi.org/project/orloj-sdk/) and [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/orloj) HTTP API SDKs ([orloj-python-sdk](https://github.com/OrlojHQ/orloj-python-sdk), [orloj-js-sdk](https://github.com/OrlojHQ/orloj-js-sdk)), with PyPI and npm badges.

### Changed

- **Tool runtime docs**: Core concepts, tool reference, and tool concept pages now list seven transport types (HTTP, external, gRPC, webhook-callback, MCP, CLI, WASM) and four isolation modes (none, sandboxed, container, WASM), correcting previous counts and removing references to the unimplemented `queue` type.

### Removed

- **`queue` tool type**: Removed from validation and documentation. The type was accepted by `spec.type` validation and documented, but no queue runtime existed — tools with `type: queue` silently fell through to the HTTP client at runtime. A future queue transport can be re-introduced when a `QueueToolRuntime` implementation is available.

### Fixed

- **AgentPolicy enforcement in message-driven mode**: `blocked_tools` and `allowed_models` checks (`EnforcePoliciesForAgent`) are now enforced in message-driven execution mode. Previously these AgentPolicy fields were only checked in synchronous mode, allowing agents in message-driven (production) deployments to use blocked tools or disallowed models without error.
- **ToolApproval in synchronous mode**: The synchronous execution path now passes a `GovernedToolApprovalContext` to the governed tool runtime and creates a `ToolApproval` resource when approval is required. Previously, sync mode passed `nil`, causing approved tools to re-trigger approval on every re-execution after human approval.
- **Tool type dispatch**: `GovernedToolRuntime` now explicitly routes every validated `spec.type` (`http`, `external`, `grpc`, `webhook-callback`, `mcp`, `cli`, `wasm`) to its correct transport runtime. Previously only `mcp` and `cli` were explicitly dispatched; all other types — including `external`, `grpc`, and `webhook-callback` — fell through to the base HTTP client regardless of their declared type. Unknown types now fail closed with an explicit error instead of silently executing as HTTP.
- **HTTP tool registry propagation**: The default `HTTPToolClient` created when callers pass `nil` as the base runtime now receives the tool capability registry. Previously, both production call sites (`task_controller` and `agent_message_consumer`) passed `nil`, which created an `HTTPToolClient` without a registry — causing every low/medium-risk HTTP tool to fail with "unsupported tool" instead of executing.
- **Task controller**: `reconcilePending` no longer increments `status.attempts`; attempts are counted when a task is claimed in the store (`applyTaskClaim`), avoiding duplicate increments if a pending task is reconciled after claim.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **`GET /v1/auth/config`**: `setup_token_required` indicates when `ORLOJ_SETUP_TOKEN` is set so clients can require `setup_token` on initial setup; the web console setup page shows a setup-token field when applicable. `orlojctl status` includes `setup_token_required` in table/JSON output.

### Fixed

- **Sequential agent handoffs**: Downstream agents in sequential task execution now receive the upstream agent's actual output (`result.Output`) before falling back to the last event message, instead of being handed generic values such as `worker completed`.
- **Postgres task claiming**: Worker claim SQL used placeholder indices `$2`/`$3` while the driver bound arguments as `$1`/`$2`, causing `could not determine data type of parameter $1` (SQLSTATE 42P18) during embedded worker reconcile when both region and assigned-worker hints were set.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Native CLI tool type (`spec.type: cli`) for invoking local binaries with execve-style argv, Go `text/template` argument mapping, and container-sandboxed execution by default. Credentials are injected via `spec.cli.env_from` (no `spec.auth` for CLI tools). Worker flags `--cli-tool-allowed-commands` and `--cli-tool-max-argv-length` provide additional safety controls.

### Changed

- **OpenAPI**: Regenerated `openapi/openapi.yaml` from `openapi/build_openapi.py` with concise `info.description`, **secrets** tag documentation for redaction/`***` merge, a supported replacement-style namespaced PUT rename note in `info`, model-endpoint/secret operation summaries, and `openapi/schemas/secret.yaml` field/resource descriptions. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#openapi) documents the generator workflow.
- **Model routing (`openai-compatible`)**: Split `openai-compatible` into a dedicated provider plugin (with `openai_compatible` alias) so it no longer inherits strict `openai` API-key requirements by alias. `openai-compatible` now supports both authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints, while `openai`, `anthropic`, and `azure-openai` remain auth-required.
- **Model endpoint create UX (web console)**: The create dialog now shows pre-create warnings for common local-model misconfiguration: using `/v1` with native `provider: ollama`, cloud-style model IDs on local/self-hosted endpoints, and missing `auth.secretRef` on providers that require it.
- **Docs alignment (model auth + local Ollama)**: Updated model endpoint reference/concepts/guides/troubleshooting/configuration docs to reflect runtime behavior: `openai-compatible` auth is optional, native Ollama uses root base URL (not `/v1`), and model secret env fallback is `ORLOJ_SECRET_<name>` (prefix-configurable).

### Fixed

- **API PUT rename (namespaced resources)**: For agents, agent systems, tools, secrets, memories, agent policies, agent roles, tool permissions, tasks (including **task log** rows in Postgres), task schedules, task webhooks, workers, model endpoints, and MCP servers, PUT keeps `metadata.name` from the body when it differs from the URL path and **moves** the stored object to the new scoped key (409 if the target name already exists). Previously many handlers overwrote the body name from the path, so YAML renames appeared to save but reverted.
- **MCP server detail save**: Added `PUT /v1/mcp-servers/{name}` support in the API handler/store path (including `If-Match` preconditions and rename conflict handling), so MCP server edits from the UI YAML tab now persist instead of returning method-not-allowed.
- **Secret PUT / YAML tab**: Bodies that still contain the API redaction placeholder `***` in `spec.data` / `spec.stringData` (as returned by GET) are merged with the stored secret before validation, so renaming or editing metadata without re-entering secret material no longer fails with invalid base64.
- **Resource YAML detail tabs (frontend, all kinds)** — agents, agent systems, tools, secrets, memories, MCP servers, policies, roles, tool permissions, tool approvals, tasks, task schedules, task webhooks, workers, model endpoints: YAML saves use the **route** name for PUT/DELETE, **re-fetch** the resource immediately before PUT to merge a current `resourceVersion` (avoids 404/409 from stale cache or editor JSON), **update** the detail query cache from the PUT response, **navigate** when `metadata.name` changes after save, and show a **load error** instead of stuck loading when GET fails. Workers use the existing cluster-wide list lookup and a dedicated `["Worker","detail",name]` query key.
- **Issue #8 (local/self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints)**: Model endpoints using `provider: openai-compatible` no longer fail with `requires auth.secretRef` when no auth is needed (for example local Ollama `/v1`). If `auth.secretRef` is provided, the secret is still resolved and forwarded as bearer auth.
- **OpenAI-compatible request auth header behavior**: `Authorization` is now omitted when no API key is configured, preventing invalid empty-bearer requests to unauthenticated self-hosted providers.
- Token and user name path segments containing encoded slashes (`%2F`) are now rejected. Previously the slash check ran before URL-decoding, so `%2F` bypassed validation.
- Token CRUD audit events now explicitly attach caller identity in the handler, matching the pattern used by user CRUD handlers for consistency.
- In-memory `UpsertUser` logs a warning when an existing user's `CreatedAt` timestamp is unparseable instead of silently resetting it.
- YAML `Tool` manifest parsing: nested JSON Schema `type` keys under `spec.input_schema` no longer overwrite `spec.type` (fixes `orlojctl validate` for CLI tool examples with schemas).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Native multi-user authentication** (`--auth-mode native`): local username/password auth with bcrypt-hashed passwords, session cookies, and role-based access control.
- **API token management**: named bearer tokens stored with SHA-256 hashes. CRUD via `POST /v1/tokens`, `GET /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/{name}` (admin-only).
- **Multi-user admin API**: `POST /v1/auth/users`, `GET /v1/auth/users`, `DELETE /v1/auth/users/{username}` for managing local accounts (admin-only). Server-generated passwords returned once on creation.
- **Named bearer token format**: `name:token:role` alongside the existing legacy `token:role` format; env tokens (`ORLOJ_API_TOKENS`) checked first, then store-managed tokens.
- **First-user bootstrap**: `/v1/auth/setup` creates the initial admin account; optionally protected by `ORLOJ_SETUP_TOKEN` env var.
- **Auth identity propagation**: bearer and session callers carry `AuthIdentity` (name, role, method) through request context for audit logging. Bearer principals logged as `token-name` or `bearer:<role>`.
- **Audit logging for admin operations**: token and user create/delete events emitted via the audit extension with principal, resource kind, and action.
- `orlojctl`: `create token`, `get tokens`, `delete token` commands for API token lifecycle.
- `orlojctl`: `admin create-user`, `admin list-users`, `admin delete-user` commands for local user management.
- `orlojctl`: `auth whoami` queries `/v1/auth/me` and prints current identity.
- `orlojctl`: `admin reset-password --username ... --new-password ...` for targeted password resets (invalidates target sessions).
- `orlojctl`: global `--namespace` / `-n` default for namespace-aware commands; `apply` supports `--dry-run` and optional namespace override on manifest payloads.
- `orlojctl`: `approve` / `deny` for pending tool approvals (`tool-approval`), with optional `--decided-by`, `--reason`, and namespace flags.
- `orlojctl`: richer `get` (fetch by resource name, `-o table|json|yaml`, `tool-approvals` list view, memory entry listing, namespace filter for task watch).
- `orlojctl`: `describe`, `edit`, `diff`, `wait`, `cancel task`, `retry task`, `top`, `messages`, `metrics`, `health`, `status`, and shell `completion` (bash/zsh/fish).
- OpenAPI: optional `reason` on the tool approval decision request body (`openapi/schemas/common.yaml`).
- OpenAPI: full schema and endpoint documentation for all OSS auth and token endpoints.
- PostgreSQL migration `009_auth_users_and_tokens` creating `auth_local_users` and `auth_api_tokens` tables with backfill from env-configured admin credentials.
- Startup warning when `--auth-mode native` is active but `ORLOJ_SETUP_TOKEN` is not set.

### Changed

- `/v1/auth/me` now returns identity fields (`method`, `name`, `role`, compat `username`) for UI/CLI bootstrap.
- `/v1/auth/admin/reset-password` requires an explicit `username` field and invalidates the target user's sessions.
- Native session authorization now uses the actual logged-in user's role instead of a hardcoded default.
- `orlojctl`: `main` exits with `cli.ExitCode(err)` so coded CLI errors can use non-default exit statuses.

### Fixed

- API: SSE watch endpoints (`/v1/events/watch`, resource `…/watch` URLs) work again when requests use bearer authentication (the auth middleware response wrapper now forwards `Flush` to the underlying connection).
- API: session deletion failures after password change, password reset, and user deletion are now logged instead of silently ignored.
- OpenAPI: `/v1/auth/change-password` spec now correctly declares authentication as required (matching the actual server behavior).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- `orlojctl apply -f <dir>` now skips runnable `Task` manifests by default (`spec.mode: run` or omitted mode). Use `--run` to include runnable tasks in directory applies. Single-file apply behavior is unchanged.
- Internal CLI file naming was aligned from `agentctl*` to `orlojctl*` and the `Makefile` now uses `ORLOJCTL` as the canonical CLI variable with backward-compatible `AGENTCTL` alias support.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- OpenAPI 3.1 specification for the full v1 API surface
- `orlojctl validate` command for offline manifest validation
- Guided "first agent system in 5 minutes" tutorial ([docs](https://docs.orloj.dev/guides/five-minute-tutorial)), linked from the docs home page, guides overview, README, and quickstart

### Changed

- `orlojctl init` now takes a positional `<name>` argument that sets both the output directory and resource prefix; `--blueprint` defaults to `pipeline`; `--name` and `--dir` flags removed
- `orlojctl apply -f` accepts a manifest **file or directory** (same recursive discovery as `validate` for `.yaml`, `.yml`, and `.json`); applies each file and aggregates errors

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- GoReleaser now produces per-binary archives (orlojd, orlojworker, orlojctl
  are separate downloads instead of a single combined archive)

### Added

- `scripts/install.sh` for curl-based binary installation

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- Initial public release
- 15 resource kinds: Agent, AgentSystem, ModelEndpoint, Tool, Secret, Memory,
  AgentPolicy, AgentRole, ToolPermission, ToolApproval, Task, TaskSchedule,
